## Requirments:
- a Galaxy A21s
- A computer (preferably running Windows)
- an USB cable
- Common sense

Note: This guide is tested on the SM-A217F, but it may work on other A21s varients. If you brick your phone, I take no responsibility, but I can help you unbrick it.

## Unlocking your bootloader
To unlock your bootloader, you have to enable OEM unlocking. To enable OEM unlocking, go to Developer Options. To access Developer Options, go to About Device or sometimes it's called About Phone.
